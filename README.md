This repo was developed to showcase Ansible Automation Platform and Event-Driven Ansible.

## Presentation Abstract

Software Image Management (SWIM) is a repeatable framework in which engineers can produce repeatable, safe outcomes for efficient software upgrades for devices. This produces faster response to vulnerability management, more predictable maintenance schedules, and hours of an engineerâ€™s life saved in the middle of the night.

**Reusability:** Building functions in small roles or playbooks allow for use of that function in many different scenarios (testing)

**Consumability:** Building a common workflow to upgrade devices in a multi-OEM environment

**Improvement:** Testing, Testing, Testing. Not only of device functionality, but of service health pre- and post-upgrade. This allows for peace of mind that an update has not introduced system-wide issues. Automation engineers can iterate further tasks such as documentation, ticketing, clearing alerts, etc.

Get back to bed sooner!
